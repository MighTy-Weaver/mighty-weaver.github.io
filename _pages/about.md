## About me

I‚Äôm a third-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Professor Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/).
Currently, I'm an applied scientist intern at Amazon Rufus LLM in Palo Alto, working with [Dr. Xin Liu](https://seanliu96.github.io/) and [Dr. Qingyu Yin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P-mBKNYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&inst=1381320739207392350).
Previously, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/). 
I also interned as an applied scientist at Amazon Search Experience Science in Palo Alto, where I worked with [Dr. Limeng Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pfd4pUkAAAAJ&inst=1381320739207392350), [Dr. Xin Liu](https://seanliu96.github.io/), and [Dr. Chen Luo](https://chen-luo.com/). 
I received my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from HKUST in 2022 and am currently funded by the [HKPFS](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/scholarships/hong-kong-phd-fellowship-scheme) award.

## Research Interest

I'm mainly interested in the research of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.
Currently, I'm working on:

- Unlocking **Trustworthy Creativity and Generalizable System II Reasoning** within LLMs via [
  *Conceptualization*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10885) ([üêà](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.733.pdf), [üöó](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.902.pdf), [üïØÔ∏è](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.128.pdf))
  and *Metaphysical Reasoning* ([ü™ê](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02106))
- **Human Behavior Understanding via Complex Intention Modeling** with Large Foundation Models in
  E-Commerce ([FolkScope](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.76.pdf), [IntentionQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10173), [MIND](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10701), [üìú](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15196)) and Social Media ([MIKO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18169.pdf))
- Scientific Knowledge Exploration via Large Language Model ([arXiv2Table](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10284), [Science Hierarchography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13834), [ClaimCheck](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21717v1))
