## About me

Hi there! Welcome to my personal homepage. 
I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Professor Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). 
I am also an incoming Ph.D. student visitor at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I will be supervised by [Prof. Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/). 
Previously, I was an applied scientist intern at Amazon in Palo Alto, CA, USA, working with [Dr. Limeng Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pfd4pUkAAAAJ&inst=1381320739207392350), [Dr. Xin Liu](https://seanliu96.github.io/), and [Dr. Chen Luo](https://chen-luo.com/). 
I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the same institution in 2022, and I am currently funded by the [HKPFS](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/scholarships/hong-kong-phd-fellowship-scheme) award.

## Research Interest

I'm mainly interested in the research of Natural Language Processing. In the era of Large Language Models, I'm actively
working on:

- Unlocking **Trustworthy Creativity and Generalizable System II Reasoning** within LLMs via [
  *Conceptualization*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10885) ([🐈](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.733.pdf), [🚗](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.902.pdf), [🕯️](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.128.pdf))
  and *Metaphysical Reasoning* ([🪐](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02106))
- **Human Behavior Understanding via Complex Intention Modeling** with Large Foundation Models in
  E-Commerce ([FolkScope](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.76.pdf), [IntentionQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10173), [MIND](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10701)) and Social Media ([MIKO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18169.pdf))
